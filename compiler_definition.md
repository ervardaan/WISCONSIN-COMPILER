What is a compiler?

A recognizer (of some source language L).

A translator (of programs written in L into programs written in some object or target language L').

#### A compiler is itself a program, written in some host language. (In cs536, students will implement a compiler for a simple source language using Java as the host language.)

## The Scanner
The scanner is called by the parser; here's how it works:

The scanner reads characters from the source program.
The scanner groups the characters into lexemes (sequences of characters that "go together").
Each lexeme corresponds to a token; the scanner returns the next token (plus maybe some additional information) to the parser.
The scanner may also discover lexical errors (e.g., erroneous characters).
The definitions of what is a lexeme, token, or bad character all depend on the source language.

## The Parser
Groups tokens into "grammatical phrases", discovering the underlying structure of the source program.
Finds syntax errors. For example, in Java the source code
position = * 5 ;
corresponds to the sequence of tokens:
IDENT ASSIGN TIMES INT-LIT SEMI-COLON
All are legal tokens, but that sequence of tokens is erroneous.
Might find some "static semantic" errors, e.g., a use of an undeclared variable, or variables that are multiply declared.
Might generate code, or build some intermediate representation of the program such as an abstract-syntax tree.

## The Semantic Analyzer
The semantic analyzer checks for (more) "static semantic" errors, e.g., type errors. It may also annotate and/or change the abstract syntax tree (e.g., it might annotate each node that represents an expression with its type). 

## The Intermediate Code Generator
The intermediate code generator translates from abstract-syntax tree to intermediate code. One possibility is 3-address code (code in which each instruction involves at most 3 operands).

## The Optimizer
The optimizer tries to improve code generated by the intermediate code generator. The goal is usually to make code run faster, but the optimizer may also try to make the code smaller.

## The Code Generator
The code generator generates object code from (optimized) intermediate code.
